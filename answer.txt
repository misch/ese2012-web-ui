1) - the framework will receive the http request
   - then the router will find the route that will accept this request. The first route that matches the request is invoked.
   - the application code will be executed.
   - then finally the action method will be given as http response.

2) GET is conventionally idempotent. That means, it doesn't change the state, so results can be cached, bookmarks can be made safely etc. It has also a practical side. The google spider will follow all hyperlinks. Therefore if you have the 'delete' action as a hyperlink that does a 'get' request, then the google spider can delete all your data.

3) In the view.
